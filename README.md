👋 Hey

I'm an iOS and Web developer, currently working at [Fancy Pixel](https://www.fancypixel.it/) and as a freelancer. 
I mainly work with Swift (you'll find a bunch of iOS libraries used by many in my repos), but also work a lot with React for the web.
Once I close my laptop I get into my workshop for some hand tools woodworking 🔨

### Get in touch

Want to collaborate on a new OSS project? Don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm also available for freelance work on iOS.
